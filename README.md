App for facemask detection.

Due to large size of dataset, only some images could be used for training/validation. Therefore the model evaluation result is not very good.
These could have been stored on S3 for future use, but for this submission, created the dataset here.
Also, the images sent by user through POST could have also been on S3 and link passed, but for now, using a static image.
